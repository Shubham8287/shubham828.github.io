I am blessed to announce that I have been selected for Google Summer of Codes 2020 with GCompris! I would really like to thank my mentors for giving me this opportunity.

So yeah, I am really excited to begin one more journey with Gcompris after successfully completing SoK this year. loads of fun and a very productive summer is waiting for me ahead. I am ready to grasp it with both hands.

I would say the key factor for my selection in GSoC is my involvement with community. I have been contributing since last December, I was active on IRC, discussing stuffs and also submitted my proposal for reviews, quite early which gave a decent amount of time to mentors to review it properly and suggest appropriate changes.

Stay tuned, I will share my goals and further journey with Gcompris in upcoming blogs.
