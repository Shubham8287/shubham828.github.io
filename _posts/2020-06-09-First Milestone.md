Hello Everyone,

The first week has been completed with an amazing start for me.  I have completed my first milestone i.e sudoku activity. You can see implemented datasets in the below image.

For this activity, Testing was a more time-consuming task rather than implementation. I have solved countless sudoku's while adding datasets in this :). Surprisingly this activity didn't bring up any unexpected behavior or bug (yeah that happens rarely) and it's now in the "user testing" stage before getting merged.

This time in GSoC, I am working on my separate branch and it feels good to work on your own branch, now I have to think a bit more before writing my commit messages :).

Stay safe and healthy.
