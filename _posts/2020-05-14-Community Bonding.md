It’s been 10 days since the GSoC result was announced and it’s still beyond belief that I am selected for GSoC.
 
This Month is for community bonding and fortunately I already have quite good bonding with mentors. I am also utilising this time in learning some more git and QML and now I am planning to start reading code for all the activities on which I have to work this summer. So, I might disturb mentors a bit more from now :).
 
GCompris has been working on adding multiple datasets to activities for a long time and in this GSoC, I am taking forward my SoK work and adding multiple datasets to some more activities.
 
The activities I am going to deal with -
* Sudoku 
* Share pieces of candies
* Locate the region
* Categorization
* Gnumch equality
* Gnumch inequality
* Build the same model
* find the details
 
This much for now, My further blogs will keep you updated with my progress.
In the meantime you can try GCompris from the [link](https://gcompris.net/wiki/Installation) or directly install from Play Store and try interesting activities.
 
Stay safe and have fun.
